# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Description
The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Java-based project that implements various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Priority Scheduling, Round-Robin (RR), and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ). The simulator allows users to add CPU burst tasks with different priorities and time quanta, and it manages the execution of these tasks using the specified scheduling algorithms. The project includes a timer mechanism to simulate the passage of time and handle task completion and preemption. Additionally, it features comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling**
- **Timer Mechanism for Task Simulation**
- **Unit Tests for Each Scheduling Algorithm**

## Technologies
- **Java**
- **JUnit**

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Multithreading
- Concurrency
- CPU Scheduling
- Simulation
- Software Design
- Problem Solving
- Unit Testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trungpham1210/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### Running the Tests
1. Navigate to the test directory.
2. Run the test classes using JUnit.

### Usage
1. Create instances of the different schedulers (e.g., `FirstComeFirstServedScheduler`, `PriorityScheduler`, `RRScheduler`, `MultilevelFeedbackQueueScheduler`).
2. Add CPU burst tasks to the schedulers.
3. Simulate the passage of time and observe the scheduling behavior.
